     The process for attacking usually starts with the player attacking the monster first. This attack number is given by the player's level added with their temporary level (given by a weapon).
     
     - If ther player does _not_ have a weapon, their temporary level is set between 1 and 5 randomly each time.
     
     The enemy may have the ability to deflect and ignore damage on a random basis. If the level is set to 0 or below immediately, the enemy is destroyed and the player cna leave. Otherwise, the enemy takes the chance to attack based on its level.
